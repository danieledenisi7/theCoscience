# theCoscience

Daniele’s Conscience born as a collection of all the sentences that I’m told quite often, from a large amount of people, everyday. 

I wanted to collect them in order to have a sort of digital conscience that always displays me these sentences, a sort of encourage in doing everything better in my life, or just for fun.

The App is just a collection of sentences, and the widget displays a randomic one among them. I made the widget configurable so that you can choose to hide the emoji.

## Widget

The widget take one randomic sentence among the ones contained in the SentenceProvider.swift file, that has already the related emoji.
So this is the result:

For creating the widget I used the Apple's WidgetKit framework, in fact the implementation of the widget was really easy, you just need to go in File -> New -> Target

You can use this app as basis for your project.
